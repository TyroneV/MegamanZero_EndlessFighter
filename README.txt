I made an new endless fighting game made in Unity using mostly Megaman Zero assets.
I have a lot of experience with Unity during my years in collage so I decided to make a game.
There's an endless wave of enemies spawning and the world is also endless. 
The mobs spawn depending on your location so it's impossible to escape them.
I'm using an alpha version of Unity and it causes my code to have warnings of having no values assigned even when I try to assign them, 
I couldn't migrate to a more stable version which is 2019 version because I get a lot of errors,
fortunately they don't affect anything that would ruin the game. 

Xbox controller will work as well as a mouse and keyboard
Xbox controls are similar to the PS1 Megaman X games:
	Left Analog (movement), A (Jump),Y (Z-Saber) , B (Dash)
Mouse and Keyboard:
	AWSD/Directional Keys (Movement), Space (Jump), Left Mouse Button(Z-Saber), Left Shift (Dash)

1.Object-oriented design principles - Implementation uses OOP principles
2.Interactive  - It's an interactive game
3.Library usage - Uses Unity Engine 2020.2.0a12 Alpha version. 
It also should work with a later version but not an older version
4.Creativity: It's a completely new game made from scratch in Unity, an endless figther but uses megaman zero/x/zx assets
5 Correctness: The game works as intended. "It's not a bug it's a feature" - bethesda
